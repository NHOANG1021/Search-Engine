In general, the longer that the query became, the faster that it performed since we are doing boolean AND retrieval.
At first, queries were inconsistent just using cosine similarity so we revamped our ranking system to merge both 
pagerank and tf-idf scores to fix that issue. However, the shorter, more common words such as ‘uci’ would typically 
take the longest for our search engine to obtain results. We handled this by utilizing partial indexes and optimizing 
the pagerank and tf-idf to run with better Big-O notation.
